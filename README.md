Hi, I’m Joshua Graber (@joshuagraber). 

I'm a self-taught developer.

I’m interested in working in Ed Tech, Health Tech, the Arts, and/or Non-Profits.

Currently learning Node.js to get on the road to full stack!

I'd love to collaborate in interesting projects. If you want to work together, let's do it.

Let's talk: Hit me up at joshua.d.graber@gmail.com
