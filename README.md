Hi, I’m Joshua Graber (@joshuagraber). 

I'm a new developer learning front-end development and full-stack JS.

I’m interested in working in Ed Tech, Health Tech, the Arts, and/or Non-Profits.

Currently learning React and Node.js.

I'd love to collaborate in interesting projects. I'm a beginner, but if you want to work together, let's do it.

Let's talk: Hit me up at joshua.d.graber@gmail.com
